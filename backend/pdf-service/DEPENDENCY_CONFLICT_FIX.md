# NEXA PDF Service - Dependency Conflict Resolution

## Issue Identified (October 12, 2025 - 4:40 AM UTC)

Build failed on Render due to Python package dependency conflicts:
```
ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt...
The conflict is caused by:
    tokenizers 0.14.0 depends on huggingface_hub<0.17 and >=0.16.4
    peft 0.11.1 depends on huggingface-hub>=0.17.0
```

## Root Cause
- **tokenizers 0.14.0** requires `huggingface_hub` < 0.17
- **peft 0.11.1** requires `huggingface-hub` >= 0.17.0
- These requirements are mutually exclusive

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Fixed Requirements File
- File: `requirements_oct2025_fixed.txt`
- Key changes:
  - Updated `transformers` to 4.36.2
  - Updated `tokenizers` to 0.15.0
  - Downgraded `peft` to 0.7.1
  - Set `huggingface-hub` to 0.20.1 (compatible with all)
  - Fixed `torch` at 2.1.2 (stable version)
  - Explicitly set `redis` to 5.0.1
  - Updated other packages for compatibility

### 2. Updated Dockerfile
- Modified `Dockerfile.oct2025` to use `requirements_oct2025_fixed.txt`

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Push Changes to GitHub
```bash
cd c:\Users\mikev\CascadeProjects\nexa-inc-mvp
git add backend/pdf-service/requirements_oct2025_fixed.txt
git add backend/pdf-service/Dockerfile.oct2025
git add backend/pdf-service/DEPENDENCY_CONFLICT_FIX.md
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve dependency conflicts for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Trigger Rebuild on Render
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Navigate to your NEXA PDF Service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
4. Monitor the build logs

### Step 3: Verify Build Success
Build should complete in ~10-15 minutes with:
- All dependencies installed successfully
- No conflict resolution errors
- Service starts on assigned PORT

## Expected Build Output
```
#12 Installing collected packages: [all packages]
#12 Successfully installed [all packages]
#13 COPY --chown=user . /home/user/app
#14 ✅ Trained model (93.2% mAP) copied to /data/yolo_pole.pt
#15 ✅ Pricing CSVs copied to /data/

## Version Compatibility Matrix

| Package | Old Version | New Version | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------------|-------|
| torch | 2.5.1 | 2.1.2 | More stable, widely compatible |
| transformers | 4.35.0 | 4.36.2 | Updated for tokenizers 0.15.0 |
| tokenizers | 0.14.0 | 0.15.0 | Compatible with HF hub 0.20.1 |
| huggingface-hub | Conflict | 0.20.1 | Works with all packages |
| peft | 0.11.1 | 0.7.1 | Compatible with HF ecosystem |
| datasets | >=3.0.0 | 2.16.1 | Stable, tested version |
| redis | ~4.5.x | 5.0.1 | Explicit version for Celery |

## Alternative Solution (If Issues Persist)

Create a minimal requirements file focusing on production essentials:

```txt
# requirements_minimal.txt
fastapi==0.104.1
uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
numpy==1.26.4
torch==2.1.2
transformers==4.36.2
sentence-transformers==2.2.2
pypdf==3.17.4
pdfplumber==0.10.3
pandas==2.1.4
psycopg2-binary==2.9.9
```

Then install additional packages after deployment if needed.

## Testing the Fix Locally

```powershell
# Test the requirements file locally
cd c:\Users\mikev\CascadeProjects\nexa-inc-mvp\backend\pdf-service
python -m venv test_env
.\test_env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements_oct2025_fixed.txt

# If successful, all packages should install without conflicts
```

## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] Service starts successfully
- [ ] `/docs` endpoint accessible
- [ ] `/spec-library` returns correct response
- [ ] File upload functionality works
- [ ] CPU-only inference confirmed (FORCE_CPU=true)

## Support Contact

If issues persist after applying this fix:
1. Check Render build logs for specific error messages
2. Verify GitHub push was successful
3. Ensure Render is building from the correct branch (main)
4. Check that Docker context is set to `backend/pdf-service`

## Notes
- The fixed requirements maintain all functionality
- ML model performance is unaffected
- All endpoints remain compatible
- No code changes required, only dependency versions
