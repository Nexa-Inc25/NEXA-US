# üîß Infraction Detection Improvements

## Problem Fixed
The analyzer was only detecting infractions if they contained very specific keywords on individual lines. This resulted in **0 infractions found** for most audits.

## What Changed

### 1. **Structured Pattern Matching** (NEW)
Now detects infractions using regex patterns:
```
INFRACTION #1: ...
INFRACTION #2: ...
```
This captures the full infraction block (multiple lines) including:
- Location details
- Issue description  
- Status (GO-BACK, VIOLATION, etc.)
- Required corrections

### 2. **Expanded Keyword Detection**
**Old keywords** (only 5):
- go-back, go back, goback, infraction, violation

**New keywords** (12):
- All the above, plus:
- deficiency
- non-compliant / non compliant / noncompliant
- correction required / correction needed
- does not meet / fails to meet
- not in compliance / out of compliance

### 3. **Context Capture**
When a keyword is found, the analyzer now captures:
- 2 lines BEFORE the keyword
- 5 lines AFTER the keyword

This provides full context for each infraction.

### 4. **Better Spec Matching**
- **Increased matches**: 3 ‚Üí 5 top spec matches per infraction
- **Lower threshold**: 50% ‚Üí 40% similarity (better recall)
- **Confidence levels**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW based on match quality

### 5. **Enhanced Response Format**

**Before:**
```json
{
  "message": "No infractions found",
  "infractions": []
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "audit_file": "audit_2025.pdf",
  "total_spec_files": 47,
  "total_spec_chunks": 1202,
  "infractions_found": 10,
  "infractions_analyzed": 10,
  "analysis_results": [
    {
      "infraction_id": 1,
      "infraction_text": "INFRACTION #1: NON-COMPLIANT POLE EMBEDMENT...",
      "spec_matches": [
        {
          "source_spec": "012457 stubs for wood poles.pdf",
          "relevance_score": 78.5,
          "spec_text": "Pole embedment shall be 6 feet minimum..."
        }
      ],
      "status": "POTENTIALLY REPEALABLE",
      "confidence": "HIGH",
      "match_count": 3
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "potentially_repealable": 8,
    "valid": 2,
    "high_confidence": 5
  }
}
```

### 6. **Detailed Logging**
Now logs every step for debugging:
```
INFO: Analyzing audit: job_2025_audit.pdf
INFO: Found 10 infractions, analyzing against 1202 spec chunks
INFO: Analyzing infraction 1/10
INFO: Analyzing infraction 2/10
...
INFO: Analysis complete: 10 infractions analyzed
```

## How to Test

### Option 1: Use the test script
```bash
cd backend/pdf-service
python test_infraction_detection.py path/to/your/audit.pdf
```

### Option 2: API Call
```bash
curl -X POST https://nexa-doc-analyzer-oct2025.onrender.com/analyze-audit \
  -F "file=@your_audit.pdf" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

### Option 3: Dashboard
Upload through your web dashboard - it should now show all infractions!

## Expected Results

For an audit with **10 infractions**, you should now see:
- ‚úÖ **infractions_found**: 10
- ‚úÖ **infractions_analyzed**: 10
- ‚úÖ Each infraction with:
  - Full text (not just one line)
  - 3-5 matching spec excerpts
  - Relevance scores
  - Status determination
  - Confidence level

## Status Determination Logic

| Condition | Status | Confidence |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| No spec matches | VALID | LOW |
| Top match < 55% | VALID | MEDIUM |
| Top match 55-70% | POTENTIALLY REPEALABLE | MEDIUM |
| Top match > 70% | POTENTIALLY REPEALABLE | HIGH |

## Supported Audit Formats

### ‚úÖ Structured Format (Best)
```
INFRACTION #1: ISSUE TITLE
Location: Pole #47
Issue: Description of the problem
Status: GO-BACK REQUIRED
```

### ‚úÖ Keyword Format
```
This installation does not meet specification requirements.
Correction required: Replace with proper materials.
```

### ‚úÖ Narrative Format
```
The crew used non-compliant materials which is a violation
of Section 4.1.3. This is a go-back item.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "0 infractions found"?

1. **Check your audit format**:
   - Does it use terms like "infraction", "violation", "deficiency", "non-compliant"?
   - Or structured headers like "INFRACTION #1"?

2. **Check the logs** (in Render dashboard):
   ```
   INFO: Analyzing audit: your_file.pdf
   WARNING: No infractions detected in your_file.pdf
   ```

3. **Extract text manually** to see what the PDF contains:
   ```python
   from pypdf import PdfReader
   reader = PdfReader("your_audit.pdf")
   text = ""
   for page in reader.pages:
       text += page.extract_text()
   print(text[:500])  # First 500 chars
   ```

4. **If text extraction fails**, the PDF might be:
   - Image-based (needs OCR) ‚Üê Already enabled!
   - Password protected
   - Corrupted

## Deployment Status

‚úÖ **Deployed**: October 8, 2025
‚úÖ **Service**: https://nexa-doc-analyzer-oct2025.onrender.com
‚úÖ **Version**: Enhanced infraction detection v2

Check deployment status:
```bash
curl https://nexa-doc-analyzer-oct2025.onrender.com/spec-library
```

## Next Steps

If you still have issues:
1. Share a sample audit PDF (with sensitive info redacted)
2. Check the Render logs for warning messages
3. Test with the provided sample audit in `/test_documents/sample_audit_report.txt`
