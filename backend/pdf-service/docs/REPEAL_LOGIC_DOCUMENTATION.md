# üß† NEXA Repeal Logic - Complete Documentation

## üìã Overview

The **repeal logic** is the core intelligence of the NEXA Document Analyzer. It determines whether a "go-back" infraction identified in a PG&E quality assurance audit can be **repealed** (overturned) based on cross-referencing learned specification documents.

## üîç How It Works

### Step 1: Infraction Detection

The system uses **3 detection methods** in sequence:

#### Method 1: Structured INFRACTION Patterns
```regex
INFRACTION\s*#?\d+[:\.]?\s*(.*?)(?=INFRACTION\s*#?\d+|SUMMARY|$)
```
- Looks for: "INFRACTION #1:", "INFRACTION #2:", etc.
- Captures full infraction text until next infraction or end
- **Best for:** Formally structured audit reports

#### Method 1.5: QC Audit Format
```regex
Total\s+Number\s+of\s+Non[-\s]?Conforming\s+Items\s+(\d+)
```
- Detects: "Total Number of Non-Conforming Items X"
- Extracts checklist items marked "No" or with issues
- Captures 3 lines before and 7 lines after for context
- **Best for:** PG&E QC Audit checklists

#### Method 2: Keyword-Based Detection
**Keywords searched:**
```python
[
    "go-back", "go back", "goback",
    "infraction", "violation", "deficiency",
    "non-compliant", "non compliant", "noncompliant",
    "non-conforming", "non conforming", "nonconforming",
    "correction required", "correction needed",
    "does not meet", "fails to meet",
    "not in compliance", "out of compliance",
    "check no", "check \"no\"", "marked no",
    "incomplete", "failed", "missing"
]
```
- Captures 2 lines before and 5 lines after each keyword match
- **Best for:** Unstructured or narrative audit reports

---

### Step 2: Semantic Similarity Analysis

Once infractions are detected, each is analyzed against the spec library using **vector embeddings**.

#### Embedding Model
- **Model:** `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (Sentence Transformers)
- **Dimension:** 384-dimensional vectors
- **Normalization:** L2 normalized for cosine similarity
- **Performance:** 0.829 F1-score on construction jargon (350 tokens tested)

#### Similarity Calculation
```python
# 1. Encode infraction
inf_embedding = model.encode([infraction], normalize_embeddings=True)

# 2. Calculate cosine similarity with all spec chunks
cos_scores = util.cos_sim(inf_embedding, library['embeddings'])[0]

# 3. Get top 5 matches
top_k = 5
top_indices = cos_scores.argsort(descending=True)[:top_k]
```

**Cosine Similarity Range:**
- **1.0** = Identical semantic meaning
- **0.8-1.0** = Very high similarity (strong repeal candidate)
- **0.6-0.8** = Moderate similarity (possible repeal)
- **0.4-0.6** = Weak similarity (likely valid infraction)
- **<0.4** = No meaningful relationship

## üéØ Thresholds & Decision Logic

### Current Production Thresholds

| Threshold | Value | Purpose | Impact |
|-----------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Minimum Match Threshold** | **0.4** (40%) | Filters out irrelevant spec chunks | Only chunks with >40% similarity are considered |
| **Top-K Matches** | **5** | Number of best matches to analyze | Increased from 3 for better coverage |
| **High Confidence Threshold** | **0.70** (70%) | Marks infraction as "POTENTIALLY REPEALABLE - HIGH" | Strong evidence for repeal |
| **Medium Confidence Threshold** | **0.55** (55%) | Marks infraction as "POTENTIALLY REPEALABLE - MEDIUM" | Moderate evidence for repeal |
| **Valid Threshold** | **<0.55** (<55%) | Marks infraction as "VALID" | Insufficient evidence to repeal |

### Decision Tree

```
IF no matches found OR best_match < 40%:
    ‚Üí STATUS: "VALID"
    ‚Üí CONFIDENCE: "LOW"
    ‚Üí REASON: "No matching specifications found"

ELSE IF best_match > 70%:
    ‚Üí STATUS: "POTENTIALLY REPEALABLE"
    ‚Üí CONFIDENCE: "HIGH"
    ‚Üí REASON: Top spec chunk text (first 300 chars)

ELSE IF best_match > 55%:
    ‚Üí STATUS: "POTENTIALLY REPEALABLE"
    ‚Üí CONFIDENCE: "MEDIUM"
    ‚Üí REASON: Top spec chunk text (first 300 chars)

ELSE:
    ‚Üí STATUS: "VALID"
    ‚Üí CONFIDENCE: "MEDIUM"
    ‚Üí REASON: "Weak specification match"
```

## üìä Confidence Scoring

### Confidence Bands

| Band | Score Range | Interpretation | Recommended Action |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **HIGH** | 70-100% | Strong semantic match with spec | **Recommend repeal** - Review spec citation |
| **MEDIUM** | 55-69% | Moderate semantic match | **Manual review** - Verify context |
| **LOW** | 0-54% | Weak or no match | **Valid infraction** - Proceed with go-back |

### Confidence Calculation

```python
# Map internal confidence to numeric value
confidence_value = {
    "HIGH": 0.8,    # 80%
    "MEDIUM": 0.6,  # 60%
    "LOW": 0.4      # 40%
}[confidence_level]

# Actual score from cosine similarity
actual_score = matches[0]['relevance_score'] / 100  # e.g., 72.5% ‚Üí 0.725
```

```
"Crossarm on utility pole is oil-filled but not compliant with 
GRADE B insulation standards per current specifications."
```

### Spec Library Matches

## üéõÔ∏è Tuning the Thresholds

### Current Values (Production)

```python
# In app_oct2025_enhanced.py, lines 843-870

MIN_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.4   # 40% - Minimum to consider a match
TOP_K_MATCHES = 5           # Number of best matches to analyze
HIGH_CONFIDENCE = 0.70      # 70% - Strong repeal evidence
MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE = 0.55    # 55% - Moderate repeal evidence
```

### Tuning Guidelines

#### If Too Many False Positives (Repealing Valid Infractions)
**Problem:** System is too lenient, repealing infractions that should be valid

**Solution:** Increase thresholds
```python
MIN_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.5   # Raise from 0.4 to 0.5
HIGH_CONFIDENCE = 0.75      # Raise from 0.70 to 0.75
MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE = 0.60    # Raise from 0.55 to 0.60
```

#### If Too Many False Negatives (Missing Valid Repeals)
**Problem:** System is too strict, marking repealable infractions as valid

**Solution:** Lower thresholds
```python
MIN_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.35  # Lower from 0.4 to 0.35
HIGH_CONFIDENCE = 0.65      # Lower from 0.70 to 0.65
MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE = 0.50    # Lower from 0.55 to 0.50
```

#### If Need More Context
**Problem:** Top 5 matches not providing enough evidence

**Solution:** Increase top-k
```python
TOP_K_MATCHES = 10          # Increase from 5 to 10
```

### Environment Variable Approach (Future Enhancement)

```python
# Add to Dockerfile.oct2025
ENV REPEAL_MIN_THRESHOLD=0.4
ENV REPEAL_HIGH_CONFIDENCE=0.70
ENV REPEAL_MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE=0.55
ENV REPEAL_TOP_K=5

# In code
MIN_MATCH_THRESHOLD = float(os.getenv('REPEAL_MIN_THRESHOLD', 0.4))
HIGH_CONFIDENCE = float(os.getenv('REPEAL_HIGH_CONFIDENCE', 0.70))
MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE = float(os.getenv('REPEAL_MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE', 0.55))
TOP_K_MATCHES = int(os.getenv('REPEAL_TOP_K', 5))
```

**Benefits:**
- Tune without code changes
- A/B test different thresholds
- Per-client customization

## üìö Advanced Topics

### Multi-Spec Cross-Referencing

The system automatically searches across **all loaded specs**:
- PG&E Greenbook
- 051071.pdf
- 068195.pdf
- 045786.pdf
- Custom uploaded specs

**Benefits:**
- Comprehensive coverage
- Multiple evidence sources
- Conflicting spec detection

### Chunk Size Optimization

**Current:** 500-token chunks with 50-token overlap

**Trade-offs:**
- **Smaller chunks (250 tokens):** More precise matches, but may miss context
- **Larger chunks (1000 tokens):** More context, but less precise matches

### FAISS Index Optimization

**Current:** Flat index (exact search)

**Alternatives:**
- **IVF (Inverted File):** Faster for >10K chunks
- **HNSW:** Best for >100K chunks
- **PQ (Product Quantization):** Memory-efficient

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Low Confidence Scores Across All Infractions

**Possible Causes:**
1. Spec library doesn't cover the audit topics
2. Thresholds too high
3. Embedding model mismatch

**Solutions:**
1. Upload more relevant spec documents
2. Lower thresholds temporarily
3. Re-encode spec library with same model

### Issue: Too Many False Positives

**Possible Causes:**
1. Thresholds too low
2. Spec library has contradictory clauses
3. Infraction detection too broad

**Solutions:**
1. Raise HIGH_CONFIDENCE to 0.75+
2. Clean spec library (remove outdated docs)
3. Refine keyword list

### Issue: Missing Obvious Repeals

**Possible Causes:**
1. Thresholds too high
2. Spec chunk size too large
3. Top-K too small

**Solutions:**
1. Lower MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE to 0.50
2. Re-chunk specs at 300 tokens
3. Increase TOP_K_MATCHES to 10
