## üî• DEPLOY NOW (Choose One Method)

### Method 1: Manual Deploy on Render (EASIEST)

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find service: `nexa-doc-analyzer-oct2025`
3. Click: **"Manual Deploy"** button (top right)
4. Select: **"Deploy latest commit"**
5. Wait: 5-10 minutes for build

**Look for in logs:**
```
Multi-Spec v2.0 enabled - Supports batch upload
New endpoints: /upload-specs, /spec-library, /manage-specs
```

### Method 2: Auto-Deploy via Git Push

If auto-deploy is enabled:
```bash
# Already committed, just need to push
git push origin main

# If push fails, try:
git push https://github.com/Nexa-Inc25/NEXA-US.git main
```

Render will auto-detect and deploy.

## üéØ NEW ENDPOINTS AVAILABLE

After deployment, you'll have:

### 1. Batch Upload Multiple Specs
```bash
POST /upload-specs
```

### 2. View Spec Library
```bash
GET /spec-library
```

### 3. Manage Library
```bash
POST /manage-specs
```

### Plus Existing:
- `GET /` - API info
- `GET /health` - Health check  
- `POST /upload-spec-book` - Single spec (still works)

# Navigate to your specs folder
cd C:\path\to\your\50\specs\

# Run batch uploader
python c:\Users\mikev\CascadeProjects\nexa-inc-mvp\backend\pdf-service\batch_upload_50_specs.py . --mode replace --batch-size 10
```

**Expected output:**
```
üì¶ Starting upload of 50 files in 5 batches

‚è±Ô∏è Total time: 65.2 seconds
‚úÖ Final library contains:
   ‚Ä¢ Total files: 50
   ‚Ä¢ Total chunks: 3,247
```

### Option B: Web Interface

```bash
# Open the upload interface
start c:\Users\mikev\CascadeProjects\nexa-inc-mvp\backend\pdf-service\upload_example.html
```

spec_folder = Path("C:/path/to/your/50/specs/")

# Get all PDFs
pdf_files = sorted(spec_folder.glob("*.pdf"))

# Upload in batches of 10
batch_size = 10
for i in range(0, len(pdf_files), batch_size):
    batch = pdf_files[i:i+batch_size]
    
    files = [
        ('files', (pdf.name, open(pdf, 'rb'), 'application/pdf'))
        for pdf in batch
    ]
    
    mode = "replace" if i == 0 else "append"
    
    response = requests.post(
        f"{API_URL}/upload-specs",
        files=files,
        data={"mode": mode}
    )
    
    print(f"Batch {i//batch_size + 1}: {response.status_code}")
