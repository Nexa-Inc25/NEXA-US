# ðŸ”´ URGENT FIX: Render Build Failed - Missing uvicorn

## Problem
Your Render deployment failed with: `/usr/local/bin/python: No module named uvicorn`

## Root Cause
The `requirements.txt` file was missing `uvicorn` and `fastapi` packages that the Dockerfile needs.

## âœ… Fix Applied
I've updated `requirements.txt` to include:
```
fastapi==0.118.0
uvicorn[standard]==0.37.0
python-multipart==0.0.20
```

## ðŸš€ Deploy the Fix

### Option 1: Manual Deploy on Render
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your `nexa-api` service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Deploy latest commit"

### Option 2: Push via Git (if authentication works)
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Direct Push
```bash
# Try with your GitHub credentials
git push https://github.com/Nexa-Inc25/NEXA-US.git main
```

## Alternative Solution
If the above doesn't work, you can also update the Dockerfile to use the correct requirements file:

Change line 15 in Dockerfile from:
```dockerfile
COPY backend/pdf-service/requirements.txt ./backend/pdf-service/
```
To:
```dockerfile
COPY backend/pdf-service/requirements_oct2025.txt ./backend/pdf-service/requirements.txt
```

This would use the October 2025 requirements file which already has uvicorn.

## Verification
After deployment, the build should:
1. Install uvicorn successfully
2. Start the FastAPI server on the correct port
3. Show "Your service is live" message

## Expected Build Output
```
Successfully installed ... uvicorn-0.37.0 ...
```
