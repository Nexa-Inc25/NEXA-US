## Month 2-3: Optimization

### Performance Optimizations

#### 1. Caching Strategy
```python
# Add to app_oct2025_enhanced.py
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=100)
def cached_spec_lookup(query_hash):
    """Cache frequent spec lookups"""
    pass
```

#### 2. Async Processing
```python
# Background job processing
from celery import Celery

@app.post("/analyze-audit-async")
async def analyze_async(file: UploadFile):
    """Submit job, return job_id"""
    job = analyze_task.delay(file)
    return {"job_id": job.id}
```

#### 3. Database for Results
- Migrate from pickle to PostgreSQL
- Store analysis results
- Enable result caching
- Add search/filter capability

#### 4. Model Optimization
- [ ] Quantize model (8-bit) for faster inference
- [ ] Use GPU instances (T4) for 10x speedup
- [ ] Batch multiple audit requests
- [ ] Pre-compute common embeddings

### Monitoring Dashboard
- [ ] Set up Grafana + Prometheus
- [ ] Track requests per second
- [ ] Monitor model inference time
- [ ] Alert on slow queries (>5s)
- [ ] Dashboard for business metrics
